                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p> Hi, I'm from Baltimore, Maryland, but I currently reside in Austin, Texas.
                    I go Texas Tech University and I'm majoring in Computer Applications. I'm interested and determined 
                    to find a job in Network Engineering and, possibly, Cyber Security one day. Other than computers, I have interests in a variety of things, 
                    but I’ll name two main interests: fishing and basketball. I've been fishing since May 2025 - yes, I'm new to fishing, and I have been playing and watching
                    basketball since I was 10 years old. </p>

                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <p> I have computer/technical certifications in Comptia A+ and Comptia ITF +, and I'm currently 
                        studying for Comptia Network + certification. Since taking Computer Application Technology I at Texas Tech, 
                        I've developed HTML and CSS skills; however, I'd consider myself more of a novice those fields. </p>
