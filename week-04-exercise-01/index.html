        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="apple-funny-joke-dot-com.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>Apple Website Edit</h2>
        <p>
            I modified Apple's homepage using Chrome Devtools. I changed the main title of the homepage, also known as a headline in html,  
            and I added a few pink background elements in CSS, such as the Apple logo in the corner of the webpage, top bar,
            and lower bar above IPhone Air to pink. I wanted to change the whole black background behind the phone to
            pink but there were limitations with that; a lot boxes were tied within each other, which limits the ability
            for one edited box to make visual changes on the webpage. In a since, if you edit one box then you have to edit the other boxes 
            for changes to happen. These limitations helped me understand how complex websites can be.
