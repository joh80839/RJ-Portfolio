    <h1> About</h1>
    <p> I'm from Baltimore, Maryland, but I currently reside in Austin, Texas. I go Texas Tech University 
        and I'm majoring in Computer Applications. I'm interested and determined to find a job in Network Engineering and, possibly, Cyber Security one day.
        Other than computers, I have interests in a variety of things, but I’ll name two main interests: fishing and basketball. 
        I've been fishing since May 2025 - yes, I'm new to fishing, and I have been playing and watching
        basketball since I was 10 years old.
